# Lending Pair

The lending pair stands at the core of Wild. Anyone can create a new lending pair or provide liquidity for it permissionlessly.

A lending pair holds two assets that users can borrow in exchange for providing collateral.

Each lending pair is completely isolated from the other lending pairs which allows LPs to decide which assets they are comfortable with to accept as collateral.
